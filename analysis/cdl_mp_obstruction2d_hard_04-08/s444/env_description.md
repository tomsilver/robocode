# kinder/Obstruction2D-o4-v0

A 2D environment where the goal is to place a target block onto a target surface. The block must be completely contained within the surface boundaries.

The target surface may be initially obstructed.

The robot has a movable circular base and a retractable arm with a rectangular vacuum end effector. Objects can be grasped and ungrasped when the end effector makes contact.


## Variant

This variant has 4 obstructions.

## Action Space

The entries of an array in this Box space correspond to the following action features:
| **Index** | **Feature** | **Description** | **Min** | **Max** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | dx | Change in robot x position (positive is right) | -0.050 | 0.050 |
| 1 | dy | Change in robot y position (positive is up) | -0.050 | 0.050 |
| 2 | dtheta | Change in robot angle in radians (positive is ccw) | -0.196 | 0.196 |
| 3 | darm | Change in robot arm length (positive is out) | -0.100 | 0.100 |
| 4 | vac | Directly sets the vacuum (0.0 is off, 1.0 is on) | 0.000 | 1.000 |


## Reward

A penalty of -1.0 is given at every time step until termination, which occurs when the target block is "on" the target surface. The definition of "on" is given below:
```python
def is_on(
    state: ObjectCentricState,
    top: Object,
    bottom: Object,
    static_object_cache: dict[Object, MultiBody2D],
    tol: float = 0.025,
) -> bool:
    """Checks top object is completely on the bottom one.

    Only rectangles are currently supported.

    Assumes that "up" is positive y.
    """
    top_geom = rectangle_object_to_geom(state, top, static_object_cache)
    bottom_geom = rectangle_object_to_geom(state, bottom, static_object_cache)
    # The bottom-most vertices of top_geom should be contained within the bottom
    # geom when those vertices are offset by tol.
    sorted_vertices = sorted(top_geom.vertices, key=lambda v: v[1])
    for x, y in sorted_vertices[:2]:
        offset_y = y - tol
        if not bottom_geom.contains_point(x, offset_y):
            return False
    return True
```


## Example Usage

```python
import numpy as np
from robocode.environments.kinder_geom2d_env import KinderGeom2DEnv

env = KinderGeom2DEnv("kinder/Obstruction2D-o4-v0")
obs, info = env.reset(seed=0)
print(obs.shape)  # (69,)

# Take a random action
action = env.action_space.sample()
next_obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)

# Save and restore state
saved = env.get_state()
env.step(env.action_space.sample())
env.set_state(saved)  # restores to the saved state

# Run an episode
obs, info = env.reset(seed=1)
done = False
while not done:
    action = env.action_space.sample()
    obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
    done = terminated or truncated
```

`obs` and `action` are numpy arrays matching the tables above.

## Source Code

`KinderGeom2DEnv` is a thin wrapper. The underlying environment logic lives in the `kinder` package. To find the source files:

```python
import kinder.envs.geom2d
print(kinder.envs.geom2d.__path__)
```

Key files in that directory:
- `base_env.py` — `step()` transition dynamics and collision handling
- The environment-specific module (e.g. `motion2d.py`) — reward function (`_get_reward_and_done`), config, and scene generation
- `object_types.py` — object type definitions and feature names
